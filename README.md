## Hi 🤗 I am Chuqin Jiang 蒋楚沁!

My name is pronounced as ChuChin not ChuKing. But you can call me **💕Angeline💕** as well.

### Three cities in my life

- 18 years: **Ningbo**

I was born in Ningbo. I love ocean and seafood.

- 4 years: **Beijing**

Just finished my undergraduate in Data Journalism at Communication University of China in Beijing.

- < 1 year: **New York**

And currently studying Data Journalism at Columbia University in New York.

The abbreviations of both universities are CU and located near Subway Line 1!

### My exploration in Github

I am using Github for my data analysis and visualization. Please star me or I'll feel like a lonely coder.

Right now most of those projects are my homework/assignment. But I garantee in the future there will be more interesting pieces!

### More about myself

I hope I can do *visualization* or *coding* in a newsroom after graduation🚀

Ideal beats will be cross-border issues like:
- Climate change
- Sustainable ocean
- Cultural difference
- International trade

Or less serious things like:
- Cat😼 
- Coffee☕️ 
- Travel✈️ 
- Detective🕵🏻 
- Disney Princess👸🏻 
- Superhero 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️
