### My exploration in Github

I am using Github for my data analysis and visualization. Please star me or I'll feel like a lonely coder.

Right now most of those projects are my homework/assignment. But I garantee in the future there will be more interesting pieces!

### More about myself

I hope I can do *visualization* or *coding* in a newsroom🚀
Looking for job now...
